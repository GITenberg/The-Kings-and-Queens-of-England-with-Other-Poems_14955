<!--
[Inscription: I will add a few words respecting my kings and Queens.

They were hastily written from the impulse of the moment, for my own
entertainment, and that of my youngest grand-daughter, without the remotest
idea of printing them. This is my apology for the careless, familiar style
in which they were composed. At the request of my children I concluded to
print them, when it would have been highly proper to have furnished my
royal personages with a dress more befitting the occasion. But the state of
my eyes rendered it very inconvenient, if not hazardous to attempt it. And
as they are only intended to visit a few of my friends, I trust to their
good nature to excuse the homely garb in which they are presented.]

<h2>Preface.</h2>
<p>I must claim the indulgence of my friends for the many defects
they will find in my poems, which they will please wink at,
remembering that I was sixty years old when I commenced rhyming;
and this by way of experiment, while on a visit to my daughter, in
Brooklyn.</p>
<p>My first essay, was The Monarchs of England. I took it up for my
amusement, wishing to ascertain how much of that history I could
recollect without help from any other source than memory.</p>
<p>The rhyme is in many places far from smooth, and there are many
redundances that might with advantage be lopped off; and were it to
come under the critic&rsquo;s eye to be reviewed, I should feel it
quite necessary to improve it, (the poetry, I mean.) But as it
would require quite too much exertion for my eyes in their present
state, and as the history, dates, &amp;c., I believe, are correct,
I send it to the press &ldquo;with all its imperfections on its
head.&rdquo;</p>

Present Reign, Inclusive.</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>First, William the Norman lays claim to the crown</p>
<p>And retains it till death; then follows his son</p>
<p>The red headed William, whose life is cut short</p>
<p>By a shot from his friend, when hunting for sport.</p>
<p>Then Henry his brother takes quiet possession,</p>
<p>As Henry the first, of the great English nation.</p>
<p>Next Stephen, a kinsman gets the crown by his might,</p>
<p>But no one pretends to say he had a right.</p>
<p>Then comes Hal the second, who cuts a great figure</p>
<p>With Becket, fair Rosamond and Queen Eliner.</p>
<p>The Lion-hearted <em>Richard</em>, first of that name,</p>
<p>Succeeded his father in power and in fame;</p>
<p>He joined the Crusade to a far distant land</p>
<p>But his life was cut short by a murderous hand.</p>
<p>Next comes the <em>cruel</em> and <em>cowardly</em> John,</p>
<p>From whose hand, reluctant, Magna Charta was won.</p>
<p>Then his son Henry third, deny it who can?</p>
<p>Though unfit for a King, was yet a good man,</p>
<p>And his reign though a long one of fifty-six years</p>
<p>Was full of perplexities, sorrows, and fears.</p>
<p>His son Edward first next governs the nation,</p>
<p>Much respected and feared, in holding that station.</p>
<p>The Principality of Wales was annexed in his reign,</p>
<p>And his son Edward second, first Prince of that name.</p>
<p>But what shall I say of King Edward the third,</p>
<p>The most remarkable reign, that yet had occurred;</p>
<p>Fire arms in the war, were <em>first</em> used in his reign,</p>
<p>And the battle of <em>Cressy</em> of great note and fame,</p>
<p>To their introduction has the right to lay claim.</p>
<p>The knights of the Garter, first made in his reign</p>
<p>In honor it seems of a fair English dame,</p>
<p>The Duchess of Salisbury to whom it is said,</p>
<p>From Edward <em>peculiar</em> attentions were paid.</p>
<p>Of Richard the second we have little to say,</p>
<p>And take up the fourth Henry, the next on our way,</p>
<p>Who reigned fourteen years, when death cut him down</p>
<p>And left his good Kingdom to Henry his son;</p>
<p>But ere nine years had past, the fifth Henry was borne</p>
<p>To the region of darkness from whence none return.</p>
<p>The next reign is full of commotion and strife,</p>
<p>And Henry the sixth is seen flying for life;</p>
<p>For though King of England, we cannot but see</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s but the shadow of a king&mdash;that <em>should</em>
be;</p>
<p>And during the thirty-nine years that he reigned</p>
<p>His crown and his sceptre were feebly retained.</p>
<p>It was in this reign on her mission intent,</p>
<p>That Joan of Arc to the battle field went:</p>
<p>The French troops were elated, the English dismayed</p>
<p>At the wonderful victories achieved by her aid;</p>
<p>At length fortune turns, and &rsquo;tis needless to tell</p>
<p>Of the fate of this maiden&mdash;it is all known too well.</p>
<p>Of Edward the fourth it seems proper to say</p>
<p>That he fancied Dame Shore, when wed to Bess Gray.</p>
<p>But the fate of Jane Shore, should be warning to all</p>
<p>Who from love, or ambition, are tempted to fall.</p>
<p>When Edward the fourth departed this earth,</p>
<p>He left two little sons, both Royal by birth;</p>
<p>But ere three years had pass&rsquo;d, both met with their
doom,</p>
<p>By a most cruel uncle, cut down in their bloom</p>
<p>Of youth, love, and beauty, and laid in the tomb.</p>
<p>King Edward the fifth was the eldest one&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>Though never permitted by his uncle to reign.</p>
<p>Next comes cruel Richard, the third of that name,</p>
<p>Whose vices surpassing put others to shame.</p>
<p>When unhorsed in battle, he&rsquo;s so anxious to live,</p>
<p>That he cries &ldquo;for a horse, my kingdom I&rsquo;ll
give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the same battle he had his last fall&mdash;</p>
<p>Lamented by none, but detested by all.</p>
<p>In the next reign the wars of the roses, all ended,</p>
<p>And the red rose and white, forever were blended;</p>
<p>For when Henry the seventh took Bessy his bride,</p>
<p>The knot of the roses forever was tied;</p>
<p>And when the sceptre descended from father to son,</p>
<p>The red and the white leaves all mingled in one.</p>
<p>King Henry the eighth had quite a long reign</p>
<p>Mixed up with his Anne&rsquo;s, his Katy&rsquo;s and Jane.</p>
<p>But from this King we turn with disgust and with shame,</p>
<p>And greet with delight, the sixth Edward by name.</p>
<p>But only six years did this King fill the throne,</p>
<p>When called to resign it and lay his crown down.</p>
<p>A worthier we think, has never set</p>
<p>On the throne of Great Britain&mdash;at least not as yet.</p>
<p>With pleasure we love to contemplate him now,</p>
<p>With a bright crown of Glory, encircling his brow,</p>
<p>In the region of <em>light, love, peace</em>, and of joy,</p>
<p>Where pleasures eternal can have no alloy.</p>
<p>Sin, sickness, and death, never find entrance there,</p>
<p>For the air is all balm, and the skies ever fair;</p>
<p>The clouds of his young life have all passed away</p>
<p>And he enjoys the full light of an endless day&mdash;</p>
<p>For all who find footing on that peaceful shore,</p>
<p>Shall hunger, and thirst, and sorrow no more.</p>
<p>But once more we return to this &ldquo;dim speck of
earth,&rdquo;</p>
<p>And revisit the clime that gave Edward his birth.</p>
<p>Bloody Mary his sister, next mounted the throne,</p>
<p>But when five years had pass&rsquo;d, was obliged to lay
down,</p>
<p>Notwithstanding reluctance, her Sceptre and Crown.</p>
<p>For death to whom she had sent many a one,</p>
<p>Now called for his victim, and made her his own.</p>
<p>Not by <em>fire</em> and by <em>faggot</em> was <em>she</em>
hurried away,</p>
<p>But by painful sickness and loathsome decay.</p>
<p>Now commences the reign of the &ldquo;Good Queen
Bess,&rdquo;</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> she&rsquo;s called <em>good</em> I never could
guess:</p>
<p>Yet justice constrains me to allow in the main,</p>
<p>That her&rsquo;s was a glorious and most prosperous reign.</p>
<p>She had the good sense to know whom to admit</p>
<p>To her private councils, as men the most fit;</p>
<p>And by their advice, good sense and discretion,</p>
<p>She managed with <em>fitness</em> to govern the nation.</p>
<p>As a Queen she seems great, though <em>weak</em> as a woman,</p>
<p>And when praised as a <em>Goddess</em>, was no more than
human;</p>
<p>At the age of threescore, she loved to be compared</p>
<p>As a beauty to Venus, though crook&rsquo;d and red haired.</p>
<p>Of lovers she had full many a one,</p>
<p>Who sought, through her hand, a pass to the throne,</p>
<p>But chose to remain single; for full well she knew,</p>
<p>That in giving her hand, she gave away her power too.</p>
<p>In this reign we find ineffacible blots,</p>
<p>In the treatment of Essex, and Mary of Scots;</p>
<p>The death of the former, the Queen sorely repents,</p>
<p>And for her lost Essex she deeply laments.</p>
<p>The remorse of a Countess, in keeping his ring,</p>
<p>I leave to some rhymer, more able to sing.</p>
<p>Next James sixth of Scotland, <em>first</em> of England
became&mdash;</p>
<p>In peace and security permitted to reign.</p>
<p>In the person of James, two crowns were united,</p>
<p>And England and Scotland remain undivided.</p>
<p>With this king the reign of the Stuarts began,</p>
<p>And continued to the end of the reign of Queen Ann.</p>
<p>In the reign of Charles first, commences a strife</p>
<p>Between King and Parliament, that ends but with life;</p>
<p>This poor King was beheaded, his son had to flee,</p>
<p>And in his place Oliver Cromwell we see.</p>
<p>Now in Cromwell the ruler of England we find;</p>
<p>Right or wrong, I never could make up my mind;</p>
<p>Still all must allow (for deny it who can?)</p>
<p>That this same Oliver was a very great man.</p>
<p>In eleven years the days of the Commonwealth ended.</p>
<p>And gay Charles the second, the throne then ascended.</p>
<p>This second king Charles king of hearts might be
call&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>For many a fair one he seems t&rsquo; have enthrall&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>James second, brother of Charles second succeeded,</p>
<p>But after a reign of four years, he seceded;</p>
<p>When quitting his throne, and his country he flies</p>
<p>Over the channel to France, where he dies.</p>
<p>Next the Prince of Orange, (from Holland he came,)</p>
<p>For the crown of old England, asserted his claim</p>
<p>Through right of his wife, Princess Mary by name.</p>
<p>And William the third with Mary his wife</p>
<p>Are crowned King and Queen of England for life.</p>
<p>This princess was lovely in person and mind,</p>
<p>As a wife most devoted, a <em>friend ever</em> kind.</p>
<p>Queen Ann&rsquo;s is the next reign that in order appears</p>
<p>And it covers the space of thirteen full years.</p>
<p>Her death brought the reign of the Stuarts to a close,</p>
<p>But firm on their ruins, the House of Hanover rose.</p>
<p>With this house the reign of the Georges begins&mdash;</p>
<p>And four in succession we count up as Kings.</p>
<p>George the third, grandson of the second, so called,</p>
<p>Was for virtues and goodness of heart much extolled.</p>
<p>His reign the longest of any appears,</p>
<p>Bearing title of king for sixty-two years.</p>
<p>But when aged four score, this good king we find</p>
<p>Bereft of his senses and hearing, and blind.</p>
<p>In this reign America declared herself free,</p>
<p>And independent of rulers over the sea.</p>
<p>At length death relieved him, and he was cut down,</p>
<p>To make way for his eldest and libertine son.</p>
<p>But though of talent acknowledged the son possessed more,</p>
<p>The <em>sire&rsquo;s heart was good</em>, the <em>son&rsquo;s
corrupt at the core</em>;</p>
<p>Though admired for his beauty, and manners, and wit,</p>
<p>As a husband and father he never was fit.</p>
<p>But before we pass on to the next reign in course,</p>
<p>We have a most sorrowful tale to rehearse,</p>
<p>Of the young princess Charlotte, next heir to the crown,</p>
<p>In the spring time of life, scarce with warning cut down.</p>
<p>If ever the nation were mourners sincere,</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas when they united around the sad bier</p>
<p>Of this youthful princess so deservedly dear;</p>
<p>And stout-hearted men unaccustomed to mourn,</p>
<p>Let bitter tears fall, as they gazed on her urn.</p>
<p>But who can describe the anguish of one,</p>
<p>The heart-stricken husband apart and alone.</p>
<p>As the sun of his happiness rose to its height,</p>
<p>Death enters his dwelling, and lo! it is night;</p>
<p>The light of his house forever has fled,</p>
<p>For his loved one, his dearest, lies low with the dead.</p>
<p>In the <em>same</em> day all his fair prospects were
crossed,</p>
<p>When a <em>wife</em>, and a <em>son</em>, and a <em>kingdom</em>
he lost.</p>
<p>Next William the fourth, is proclaimed Britain&rsquo;s king,</p>
<p>For between him and his brother two deaths intervene.</p>
<p>No <em>legitimate</em> child did he leave in possession</p>
<p>Of the Crown of old England, in right of succession;</p>
<p>So the diadem passed to the youthful brow</p>
<p>Of his niece Queen Victoria, who honors it now;</p>
<p>And for her we wish, as our rhyming we close,</p>
<p>A <em>long, peaceful reign</em>&mdash;an old age of repose.</p>

<p>And day&rsquo;s brilliant sunshine hath fled,</p>

<p>It is e&rsquo;en so with me, for the eve of my day</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh! where are the friends who in life&rsquo;s early morn,</p>
<p>With me did their journey commence;</p>
<p>Some are estranged, while some few still remain,</p>
<p>And others departed long since.</p>

<p>And when I too, like them, shall be summoned away,</p>
<p>And the shadows of death on me fall,</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And though the &ldquo;dark valley&rdquo; we all must pass
through,</p>
<p>Yet surely no evil can harm</p>
<p>The <em>sheep</em>, when the Shepherd is walking there too,</p>
<p>And supports them by his mighty arm.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh! my Redeemer, wilt thou be with me then,</p>

<p>Though wild beasts of the desert may roar long and loud,</p>

<p>The bright sun of an endless day.</p>

<p>I now will endeavor, while fresh in my mind,</p>

<p>The theme's furnished for me, I've only to find</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And first on the canvass we'll Adeline place,</p>

<p>But who's this that we see, with that mild pensive air,</p>

<p>It is Ann, gentle Ann, before whom we pass by,</p>
<p>We will add--'t would be useless in any to try</p>
<p>Disposition more lovely to find.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The next is a bright noble face we espy,</p>
<p>'Tis a boy of ten years we shall find;</p>
<p>There's a spice of the rogue in that merry young eye,</p>
<p>With good sense and good nature combined.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>It's young master Alpheus--we never have found</p>
<p>One more punctual at school hour than he;</p>
<p>He's now but a lad, yet who knows when a <em>man</em>,</p>
<p>But a <em>Judge in our land</em> he may be.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Next comes little Moggy, our dear little Moggy,</p>

<p>We'll new colors select, add fresh tints to the whole,</p>
<p>And spread all on our pallet anew.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And now she appears in her own proper size,</p>
<p>Her cheeks colored by nature's warm glow;</p>
<p>With her full lustrous and speaking black eyes,</p>
<p>And rich ringlets that grace her young brow.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Walter's the last on the painting we see,</p>
<p>Little Walter, the youngest of all;</p>
<p>Look! he's repeating his lesson just now,</p>
<p>Mark the expression on that infant brow,</p>
<p>He's a <em>wonder</em>, for scholar so small.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But there's one in this grouping we look for in vain,</p>
<p>Whose image we often recall;</p>
<p>How mournfully sweet is the sound of thy name,</p>
<p>Dear Elbridge, the loved one of all.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thou wert called in the freshness of morning away,</p>

<p>May the Holy Book studied in this Sabbath School,</p>

<p>Be its doctrines received, and its precepts obeyed,</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And when one by one we shall all pass away,</p>

<p>I here engage</p>
<p>Upon this page</p>
<p class="i4">A picture to portray,</p>
<p>Of two of an age</p>
<p>Yet neither a sage,</p>
<p class="i4">But right honest hearts have they.</p>
<p>Each loves to play</p>
<p>And have his own way,</p>
<p>Yet I&rsquo;m happy to say</p>
<p class="i4">They quarrel, if ever, but seldom.</p>
<p>Though competent quite</p>
<p>To maintain their own right,</p>
<p>And even to fight,</p>
<p class="i4">Yet peace to their bosom is welcome.</p>
<p>Both go to school,</p>
<p>And learn by rule</p>
<p class="i4">That in neither a dunce we may find;</p>
<p>Both read and spell</p>
<p>And like it well;</p>
<p class="i4">Thus with pleasure is profit combined.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s eyes are black,</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s blue;</p>
<p class="i4">They both have honest hearts and true,</p>
<p class="i4">And love each other dearly:</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s father, is brother</p>

<p>But neither a sister,</p>
<p>And neither a brother,</p>
<p class="i4">To <em>play</em> with, or to <em>plague</em> him.</p>
<p>And here I propose,</p>
<p>Ere I come to a close,</p>
<p class="i4">A little advice to give;</p>
<p>To which if they heed,</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be better indeed,</p>
<p class="i4">And happier as long as they live.</p>
<p>Be sure to mind</p>
<p>Your parents kind,</p>
<p class="i4">And do nothing to vex or tease them;</p>
<p>But through each day</p>
<p>Heed what they say,</p>
<p class="i4">And strive to obey and please them.</p>
<p>Take not in vain</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s holy name,</p>
<p>Do not work,</p>
<p>Do not play</p>
<p>On God&rsquo;s holy day,</p>
<p class="i4">Nor from church stay away;</p>
<p>Always bear it in mind</p>
<p>To be gentle and kind,</p>
<p>And friends you will find,</p>
<p>And hearts to you bind,</p>
<p class="i4">I am sure I may venture to say.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re men,</p>
<p>Who sees you then</p>
<p class="i4">I hope in you models will see,</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>When writing to you, friend, a subject I&rsquo;d find</p>
<p>In which there&rsquo;s both pleasure and profit combined,</p>
<p>And though what I&rsquo;ve chosen may pain in review,</p>
<p>Yet still there&rsquo;s strange mingling of pleasure there
too.</p>
<p>Then let us go back many years that are past,</p>
<p>And glance at those days <em>much too happy to last</em>.</p>
<p>I have seen thee, my friend, when around thy bright hearth</p>
<p>Not a seat was found vacant, but gladness and mirth</p>
<p>Kept high holiday there, and many a time</p>
<p>Were mingled in pastime my children with thine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked in again, the destroyer had come,</p>
<p>And changed the whole aspect of that happy home.</p>
<p>He entered that dwelling, and rudely he tore</p>
<p>From the arms of his mother, her most cherished flower.</p>
<p>Thy heart seemed then broken, oh! how couldst thou bear</p>
<p>To live in this world, and thy idol not here?</p>
<p>Oh! heart-stricken mother, thou didst not then know</p>
<p>All the bitter ingredients in thy cup of woe.</p>
<p>The hand of thy father that cup had prepared,</p>
<p>Each drop needful for thee, not one could be spared.</p>
<p>Ere thy first wound had healed, while bleeding and sore,</p>
<p>Death entered again, and a fair daughter bore</p>
<p>From home of her childhood, to return never more.</p>
<p>How painful the shock, for in striking that blow</p>
<p>A child, parent, sister, and wife was laid low.</p>
<p>Thy strength seemed unequal that shock to sustain,</p>
<p>But death was not satiate, he soon called again,</p>
<p>And tears and entreaties were powerless to save</p>
<p>Another dear daughter from death and the grave.</p>
<p>Like a fair lily when droops its young head,</p>
<p>With little of suffering her mild spirit fled.</p>
<p>She was thy namesake, to her young friends most dear;</p>
<p>So many thy trials, so heavy to bear,</p>
<p>It seemed that much longer thou couldst not survive;</p>
<p><em>How much can the human heart bear and yet live</em>.</p>
<p>Up to this time there had always been one</p>
<p>Who shared in thy trials and made them his own;</p>
<p>Many years his strong arm had support been to thee,</p>
<p>The friend of thy youth, thy kind husband was he.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ever been with thee in weal and in woe,</p>
<p>But the time&rsquo;s just at hand when he too must go.</p>
<p>The bolt fell not single, it pierced the slight form</p>
<p>Of a child, too fragile to weather the storm;</p>
<p>The summons that took her dear father away</p>
<p>Seemed her young heart to break, she could not here stay,</p>
<p>And now in deep slumber they side by side lay.</p>
<p>I have felt, my dear friend, as I&rsquo;ve witnessed thy
grief,</p>
<p>How inadequate language to give thee relief;</p>
<p>And that <em>real relief</em> could never be found</p>
<p>Except from the hand that inflicted the wound.</p>
<p>In the furnace of fire thou wert not alone,</p>
<p>For walking beside thee had ever been one,</p>
<p>The kindest of friends, though thou could&rsquo;st not him
see,</p>
<p>For the scales on thine eyes weighed them down heavily.</p>
<p>Those scales have now fallen; look up, thou canst see</p>
<p>That look of compassion, it&rsquo;s fixed upon thee.</p>
<p>Raise thine eyes once again, see that head crowned with
thorns;</p>
<p>In those feet, hands, and side, see the deep bleeding
wounds.</p>
<p>You now know full well why such suffering was borne,</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas for thee, and for me, and for every one</p>
<p>Who trusts in his merits and on him alone.</p>
<p>Thy day is just passed, &rsquo;tis now evening with thee,</p>
<p>But the faith of the Christian is given to see</p>
<p>The star of bright promise, amid the dark gloom</p>
<p>Which shall light all thy footsteps and gild the lone tomb;</p>
<p>And at the last day mayst thou and thine stand</p>
<p>An <em>unbroken household</em> at Jesus&rsquo; right hand.</p>

<p>What period more fitting thy powers to employ</p>
<p>In the service of him, who his own life has given</p>
<p>To procure thee a crown and a mansion in Heaven.</p>
<p>As a dream that is gone at the breaking of day,</p>
<p>And a tale that&rsquo;s soon told, so our years pass away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then count that day lost, whose low setting sun</p>
<p>Can see from thy hand no worthy act done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Midst the roses of life many thorns thou wilt find,</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the cloud that is darkest, with silver is
lined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the children of Israel were led on their way</p>
<p>By the bright cloud at night, and the dark cloud by day,</p>
<p>So the Christian is led through the straight narrow road</p>
<p>That brings him direct to his home and his God;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s permitted with Saints and with Angels to stand,</p>
<p>Then weighed in the balance how light will appear</p>
<p>All the sorrows of life, with his blissful state there.</p>
<p>Oh! let us by faith take a view of him now,</p>
<p>See the crown of bright jewels encircling his brow;</p>
<p>His old tattered robe swept away by the flood,</p>
<p>Is replaced by a new one, the gift of his Lord;</p>
<p>The hand of his Saviour that garment hath wrought,</p>
<p>It is pure stainless white, free from wrinkle and spot.</p>
<p>The streets that he walks in are pav&euml;d with gold,</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s transparent as glass we are told;</p>
<p>The pure river of water of life is in view,</p>
<p>And for healing the nations, the tree of life too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need of a candle or sun there, for night</p>
<p>Is excluded forever&mdash;the Lord God is their light.</p>
<p>But here we will stop, for no tongue can declare,</p>
<p>No heart may conceive what the Saints enjoy there.</p>
<p>And these joys may be ours&mdash;oh! how blissful the
thought,</p>
<p>Ours without money, without price may be bought.</p>
<p>For us they&rsquo;ve been purchased by the Son of God,</p>
<p>At an infinite price&mdash;<em>his own precious blood</em>.</p>
<p>They wait our acceptance, may be ours if we choose,</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis <em>life</em> to accept them,&mdash;&rsquo;tis

<p>By the pale lamp of midnight we&rsquo;re seeking it too;</p>
<p>At all times and seasons, this <em>same fancied good</em></p>
<p>Repels our advances, yet still is pursued,</p>
<p>Depriving us oft, of rest needful, and food.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a pearl of great price, whose worth is
untold,</p>
<p>It can never he purchased with silver or gold;</p>
<p>Great peace it confers upon all to whom given,</p>
<p>Ever cheering their pathway, and pointing to heaven.</p>
<p>Look not to this world for a prize of such worth,</p>
<p>Or hope <em>that</em> to obtain from this perishing earth</p>
<p>Whose essence is spiritual, and heavenly its birth.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>By especial request I take up my pen,</p>
<p>To write a few lines to my dear Mrs. N.;</p>
<p>And though nothing of depth she has right to expect;</p>
<p>Yet the <em>will</em> for the <em>deed</em> she will not
reject</p>
<p>The task, on reflection, is a heavy one quite,</p>
<p>As here in the country we&rsquo;ve no news to write;</p>
<p>For what is to <em>us</em> very <em>new</em>, rich, and
rare,</p>
<p>To you in the city is stale and thread bare.</p>
<p>Should I write of Hungary, Kossuth, or the Swede,</p>
<p>They are all out of date, antiquated indeed.</p>
<p>I might ask you with me the New Forest to roam,</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s stript of its foliage, quite leafless become;</p>
<p>N.P. Willis and rival have each had their day,</p>
<p>And of rappings and knockings there&rsquo;s nought new to
say.</p>
<p>Yet do not mistake me, or think I would choose,</p>
<p>A home in the city, the country to lose;</p>
<p>The music of birds, with rich fruits and sweet flowers,</p>
<p>We all in the country lay claim to as ours.</p>
<p>A bird that&rsquo;s imprisoned, I hate to hear sing,</p>
<p>Let me catch its glad note as it soars on the wing;</p>
<p>Its carol so sweet as it&rsquo;s floating along,</p>
<p>It seems the Creator to praise in its song.</p>
<p>With the sweetest of poets I often exclaim,</p>
<p>&ldquo;God made the country,&rdquo;&mdash;let the pride of man
claim</p>
<p>The town with its buildings, its spires, and its domes,</p>
<p>But leave us in the country our sweet quiet homes.</p>
<p>The scenery around us is lovely to view,</p>
<p>It charmed when a <em>child</em>, and at three-score charms
too.</p>
<p>Then leave me the country with its birds, fruits, and
flowers,</p>
<p>And the <em>town</em>, with its pleasures and crowds, may be
yours.</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en in winter the country has right to the claim</p>
<p>Of charms equal to summer; to be sure, not the same.</p>
<p>See winter, stern monarch, as borne on the gale,</p>
<p>He comes armed <em>cap-a-pie</em> in his white coat of mail;</p>
<p>Behold what a change he hath wrought in <em>one</em> night,</p>
<p>He has robed the whole country in <em>pure spotless
white</em>.</p>
<p>He fails not to visit us once every year,</p>
<p>But finds us <em>prepared for him</em>&mdash;meets with good
cheer,</p>
<p>And a most cordial welcome from all of us here.</p>
<p>When with us he&rsquo;s quite civil and very polite,</p>
<p>In manners most courtly, and dignified quite;</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m told were he goes unexpected he&rsquo;s rough,</p>
<p>Chills all by his presence, and savage enough.</p>
<p><em>Hark, hear how it storms!</em> blowing high and yet
higher;</p>
<p>But then we&rsquo;ve books, music, and a brilliant wood
fire,</p>
<p>Where logs piled on logs give one warmth e&rsquo;en to see;</p>
<p>Oh! these evenings in winter are charming to me.</p>
<p>In good keeping these logs are with wind and the hail,</p>
<p>Everything in the country is on a <em>grand scale</em>.</p>
<p>You have nought in the city I think can compare,</p>
<p>To the bright glowing hearth from a good <em>country</em>
fire.</p>
<p>To be sure, now and then, one is cheered by the sight</p>
<p>Of wood fire in the city, but when at its height</p>
<p>Compared to <em>our fires</em>, Lilliputianal quite.</p>
<p>But here I will stop, for I think it quite time</p>
<p>To have done with my boasting, and finish my rhyme.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your missive so charming in verse,</p>
<p>So kind and descriptive, so friendly and terse;</p>
<p>It came opportune on a cold stormy day,</p>
<p>And scattered ennui and &ldquo;blue devils&rdquo; away;</p>
<p>For though in the city, where &ldquo;all&rsquo;s on the
go,&rdquo;</p>
<p>We often aver we feel only &ldquo;so so,&rdquo;</p>
<p>And sigh for a change&mdash;then <em>here</em> comes a
letter!</p>
<p>What could I desire more welcome and better?</p>
<p>But how to reply? I&rsquo;m lost in dismay,</p>
<p>I cannot in rhyme my feelings portray.</p>
<p>The <em>nine</em> they discard me, I&rsquo;m not of
<em>their</em> train,</p>
<p>They entreatingly beg, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er woo them
again;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll brave their displeasure, and e&rsquo;en write to
<em>you</em></p>
<p>A few lines of doggrel, then rhyming adieu.</p>
<p>My errors do &ldquo;wink at,&rdquo; for hosts you&rsquo;ll
descry,</p>
<p>And spare all rebuff, and the keen critic&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>I appreciate all of your calm country life,</p>
<p>And feel you are happy as mother and wife;</p>
<p>Surrounded by taste, and <em>the friend</em> so refined,</p>
<p>Who with sterling good sense, loves the delicate mind;</p>
<p>Who with <em>you</em> can admire the &ldquo;bird on the
wing,&rdquo;</p>
<p>With <em>you</em> welcome back the return of the spring;</p>
<p>Enjoying the promise of fruits and sweet flowers,</p>
<p>With music to cheer and beguile evening hours;</p>
<p>Then <em>long</em>, very long, may such hours be
given&mdash;</p>
<p>They whisper content, and the foretaste of heaven.</p>
<p>I was born in the city, the city&rsquo;s my home,</p>
<p>Yet oft in the country with pleasure I roam;</p>
<p>For <em>there</em>, I confess, the heart finds repose</p>
<p>In its pleasures and sorrows, which <em>here</em> it ne&rsquo;er
knows.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><em>There</em> no fashion, no nonsense, intrude on your
walk,</p>
<p>But rational moments of rational talk,</p>
<p>Asserting that soiries, with jewels and dress,</p>
<p>Make a very small part of life&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>Ah! this I believe, most <em>sincerely</em> I do,</p>
<p>And sympathize freely, most truly with you.</p>
<p>Now Kossuth is coming, pray what&rsquo;s to be done?</p>
<p>No pageant to welcome, to children no fun?</p>
<p>Some &ldquo;turn a cold shoulder,&rdquo; and look with
disdain,</p>
<p>Yet many there&rsquo;ll be who will follow his train.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s &ldquo;sure missed a figure,&rdquo; and &ldquo;bit
his own nose,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, many the thorn he&rsquo;ll find &lsquo;mid life&rsquo;s
rose.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then we&rsquo;ve concerts, fine readings, museum and halls,</p>
<p>With disputes, and debates, in legislative halls,</p>
<p>Ethiopian Minstrels, Shakesperian plays;</p>
<p>And yet, my dear friend, I&rsquo;m told in these days,</p>
<p>Religion&rsquo;s blessed joys are most faithfully felt,</p>
<p>With devotion&rsquo;s pure prayers the proud heart to melt;</p>
<p>That many have turned to the straight narrow road,</p>
<p>Which leadeth to peace and communion with God.</p>
<p>To <em>you</em> this assurance a welcome will find,</p>
<p>A subject of vital concern to the mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>When hither you come, do enter our door,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you my hand, perhaps something more.</p>
<p>Let me urge, if inclined, to this you&rsquo;ll reply,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll again do my best, yes, surely I&rsquo;ll try;</p>
<p>The fair one who brings it ought sure to inspire</p>
<p>Some poetical lay from Genius&rsquo; sweet lyre.</p>
<p>But Genius repels me, she &ldquo;turns a deaf ear,&rdquo;</p>
<p>And frowns on me scornful, the year after year;</p>
<p>Perhaps if I sue, in the &ldquo;sere yellow leaf,&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll open her heart, and yield me relief.</p>
<p>But wayward my pen, I must now bid adieu,</p>
<p>My friendship, dear madam, I offer to you,</p>
<p>And beg with your friends, you&rsquo;ll please place my
name,</p>
<p>The privilege grant me of doing the same.</p>

<p>And now my friend a word I&rsquo;d say</p>

<p>I shall offend the nicest ear,</p>

<p>Just before the bright cloud the Saviour received,</p>
<p>When about to return to his father in Heaven;</p>
<p>His mission accomplished, his work on earth done,</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas then that this parting injunction was given:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Feed my lambs!&rdquo; this was said to one of the
twelve,</p>
<p>Whom he called to be with him while sojourning here;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feed my lambs!&rdquo; Oh, what love was evinced by those
words,</p>
<p>What tender compassion, what fatherly care.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Three times at this meeting the question was asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?&rdquo;</p>

thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thrice this same Peter his Lord had denied,</p>

<p>That disciple soon followed his Lord whom he loved,</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>My very dear friend</p>
<p>Should never depend</p>
<p>Upon anything clever or witty,</p>
<p>From a poor country wight</p>
<p>When attempting to write,</p>
<p>To one in your far famous city.</p>
<p>Indeed I&rsquo;m inclined,</p>
<p>To fear that you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>These lines heavy, and quite out of joint;</p>
<p>And now I declare,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no more than fair,</p>
<p>Should this prove a dull letter,</p>
<p>That you write me a better;</p>
<p>And something that&rsquo;s quite to the point.</p>
<p>This having premised</p>
<p>As at present advised,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll indulge in the thoughts that incline,</p>
<p>Not with curious eye</p>
<p>The dim future to spy,</p>
<p>But glance backward to &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I recollect right,</p>
<p>It was a cold day quite,</p>
<p>And not far from night</p>
<p>When <em>the Boarding School famous</em> I entered.</p>
<p>Now what could I do?</p>
<p>Scarce above my own shoe</p>
<p>Did I dare take a view,</p>
<p>Or to speak, or e&rsquo;en move hardly ventured.</p>
<p>At this school I remained</p>
<p>Till supposed to have gained</p>
<p>Education quite good and sufficient;</p>
<p>But one in those days,</p>
<p>Thought deserving of praise,</p>
<p>Would in these, be deemed very deficient.</p>
<p>And here we will try</p>
<p>Before the mind&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>To bring forward a few of that household;</p>
<p>There were the witty,</p>
<p>Also the pretty,</p>
<p>But some very plain,</p>
<p>Not a few very vain,</p>
<p>And among them the phlegmatic and cold.</p>
<p>Though it seems out of place</p>
<p>I will here find a space</p>
<p>For some few in the lower apartment;</p>
<p>Sure this must be right,</p>
<p>They contributed quite</p>
<p>To our comfort, in their humble department.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Lydia and Polly,</p>
<p>And Peter the jolly,</p>
<p>With teeth white as ivory</p>
<p>And cheeks black as ebony,</p>
<p>So from Africa doubtless was he;</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll ascend from below,</p>
<p>And see entering just now</p>
<p>With a Parisian bow</p>
<p>And all in a glow</p>
<p>Gay Monsieur Pichon,</p>
<p>And French teacher Faucon;</p>
<p>Also V&mdash;&mdash;, the Musician,</p>
<p>And B&mdash;&mdash;, Mathematician.</p>
<p>Monsieur Laboltierre,</p>
<p>So brisk and debonnair</p>
<p>Had also been there;</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s Eggleston fair,</p>
<p>With whom none might compare.</p>
<p>Miss W&mdash;&mdash;, romantic,</p>
<p>Miss F&mdash;&mdash;, transatlantic,</p>
<p>And of others a score you might see.</p>
<p>But here I propose</p>
<p>The long list to close,</p>
<p>With addition of only one name;</p>
<p>Amidst the gay throng</p>
<p>Was one lovely and young,</p>
<p>Who brought sunshine wherever she came.</p>
<p>She had light brown hair,</p>
<p>Was graceful and fair,</p>
<p>Of children many</p>
<p>Youngest of any,</p>
<p>And Margaret this maiden they call;</p>
<p>A sweet smile she had</p>
<p>That round her lips played,</p>
<p>And with eyes bright and blue</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d a heart warm and true</p>
<p>And disposition affectionate withal.</p>
<p>One advantage she&rsquo;ll allow</p>
<p>That I have over her now,</p>
<p>The same in our youthful days, when</p>
<p>On our studies intent</p>
<p>Over school desk we bent,</p>
<p>Her Senior I always have been.</p>
<p>How like to a dream</p>
<p>Do those days to me seem,</p>
<p>When with others preparing to enter</p>
<p>On the world&rsquo;s great stage,</p>
<p>And with light heart engage</p>
<p>Our part in the drama to venture.</p>
<p>Of that school there&rsquo;s not one</p>
<p>Except thee alone,</p>
<p>Whom now living as friend I can claim;</p>
<p>Some have departed,</p>
<p>Some are false hearted,</p>
<p>And their friendship exists but in name.</p>
<p>But that friendship&rsquo;s long lived</p>
<p>That forty years has survived,</p>
<p>And may we not hope &rsquo;twill endure,</p>
<p>When in flames of fire</p>
<p>This earth will expire,</p>
<p>And old time shall itself be no more.</p>

<p>Ah! short-sighted monarch, dost thou think to pursue</p>
<p>The Israel of God, and recapture them too?</p>

<p>Or so hardened thy heart that thou can&rsquo;st not relent?</p>
<p>Then make ready thy chariots, a long way they&rsquo;ll
reach;</p>
<p>Thou hast six hundred chosen, a captain to each.</p>
<p>Now after them <em>hasten</em>, no time&rsquo;s to be lost,</p>
<p>That God worketh for them, thou&rsquo;st felt to thy cost.</p>
<p><em>Speed thee then, speed thee</em>, thou&rsquo;lt soon them
o&rsquo;ertake,</p>
<p>Thou hast so overtasked them they&rsquo;re powerless and
weak.</p>
<p>Ah! weak and defenceless they truly appear,</p>
<p>But the Lord is their rock, they&rsquo;re his special care.</p>
<p>See that pillar that&rsquo;s leading them all on their way,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bright cloud by night and a dark cloud by day;</p>
<p>And now by the Red Sea behold they encamp,</p>
<p>But <em>hark</em>! what&rsquo;s that sound, it&rsquo;s the war
horse&rsquo;s tramp.</p>
<p>Look up, see thy enemy close by thee now,</p>
<p>The sea lies before thee, ah! what canst thou do?</p>
<p>Moses bids them go forward at God&rsquo;s command,</p>
<p>When the waters divide, and they walk on dry land;</p>
<p>And the cloud that to Egypt is darkness all night,</p>
<p>To the children of Israel, is a bright shining light.</p>
<p>And now have the Hebrews all safely passed through</p>
<p>The Red Sea, which Pharaoh assaying to do</p>
<p>Is destroyed with his host, every one of them drowned,</p>
<p>Not a man saved alive, not a <em>single man found</em></p>
<p>To return to lone Egypt, the sad news to bear</p>
<p>To the widows and orphans made desolate there.</p>
<p>But list! hear the rescued their glad voices raise,</p>
<p>And to timbrel and dance add the sweet song of praise,</p>
<p>For Pharaoh hath perished beneath the dark sea,</p>
<p>And the long enslaved Hebrews are happy and free.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
